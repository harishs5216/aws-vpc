STEPS to create CUSTOM VPC

Whenever we create a VPC, a route table and a security group is created along with it.
The route table created is the main route table and it will be used by Private subnet/s.
The security group will have a default inbound rule added with the SG id (i.e. LAN as Khurram Sir would have explained)

1. Create a VPC.
2. Create subnets public and private in different availability zones.
3. Create route tables for both of the above subnets, IF not already created(read above).
4. Create an internet gateway and attach to the VPC.
5. Allocate an Elastic IP if you are going to use it.
6. Create a NAT gateway in public subnet.
7. Make sure the private route table is the main subnet. Now, if there is a requirement of making more private subnets
   then creating more route tables won't be required.
8. Associate the public route table to the public subnet.
     - Select the public route table.
     - Go to edit subnet associations.
     - Select the public subnet.
     - Save.
     
   (yes, that would be an explicit association. There is no requirement of explicit association for private subnet/s)
9. Now add ROUTES to the Route Tables.
     - Select a route table.
     - Click on Routes.
     - Edit routes.
     - Add route.
     - Destination : 0.0.0.0/0 (for now, but it might not be so in production)
	 i) Public Route table:  TARGET -> Internet Gateway (that you created above)
        ii) Private Route table: TARGET -> NAT Gateway (that you created above)
     - Save routes.

10. Modify auto-assign IP settings.
     - select the public subnet
     - click on actions
     - go to modify auto-assign IP settings
     - tick on the check box and then save

11. Enable DNS hostnames
     - go to Your VPCs
     - select the custom VPC that you created
     - click on actions
     - go to Enable DNS hostnames
     - tick the check box and then save

12. Edit Security Group rules as per requirement.

12. Congratulations! You have a fully working custom VPC created now.

13. Make sure to check if VPC is working, by launching instances in the subnets created above and using internet. TO BELIEVE.....


NOTE: If you want to add more subnets, just create a subnet in the above VPC.
      Nothing extra is required to be done as it will use the MAIN route table we created above.




If you don't know how to delete a VPC, then here are the steps.


Steps to DELETE a VPC and its related components.

1. Stop the running instances that are using that VPC.
2. Delete NAT Gateway.
3. Delete VPC.
4. Release Elastic IP.
5. Voila! It's done.


Thank me later ;)
